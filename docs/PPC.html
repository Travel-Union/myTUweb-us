<p><strong>Children&#39;s Privacy Policy</strong></p><p> UAB &quot;Travel Union&quot; (hereinafter - &quot; <strong>TU</strong> &quot; or &quot; <strong>we</strong> &quot;) is an electronic money institution, company registration number 305106882, which has an electronic money institution license of the Bank of Lithuania no. LB001966, whose registered office is Saulėtekio al. 17, Vilnius.</p><p> TU, our mobile application, provides a forum for all family members, including children between the ages of 7 and 18 (&quot; <strong>Children</strong> &quot; or &quot; <strong>You</strong> &quot;) to use TU Wallet and/or TU Card, pay for things and learn how to use money.</p><p> Your parent or legal guardian who looks after you (“ <strong>Parent</strong> ”) has opened a TU account and/or a TU card for you.</p><p> Parents can check how you&#39;re using your account, where and how much you&#39;re spending, and how much money you have in your account (so they know when to top it up). Using the TU mobile app will teach you financial responsibility, money management skills, not to mention that the TU Wallet and TU Card are much safer than using cash.</p><p> Before you start using TU Wallet and/or TU Card, we would like to explain how we collect and use your Personal Data.</p><p> Most importantly, your parents can see your personal data and are responsible for your account.
