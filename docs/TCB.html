<h2 id="your-personal-data">3. Your personal data</h2>
<p>In order to provide the account to you, we collect data regarding you and your authorised users. TU is the data controller for the personal data collected under the agreement for the purpose of providing the account to you. It is important that you and your authorised users understand how we use your personal data. As a European company we value our customers’ privacy and we process and protect the personal data of our customers and their authorised users in accordance with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Please see our <a href="https://www.mytu.co/legal-documents.html#privacy-policy.html">Privacy Policy</a> which sets out the full details on the personal data we collect, how we use it and how we keep it safe. Please inform your authorised users about our data processing by referring them to our Privacy Policy before you submit any of their personal data to us.</p>
<p>By entering into the agreement, you authorise us to collect, process and store your personal data, in accordance with our Privacy Policy, for the purpose of us providing the account to you. If you close the account, we will stop processing your personal data as we will no longer be providing the account to you, but we may continue to keep your personal data due to mandatory legislation, such as the legislation for prevention of anti-money laundering and terrorist financing.</p>
<p>As a regulated e-money institution, it is our duty to protect and keep your account information secure. We will not disclose information relating to your account to third parties outside the circle of our trusted suppliers and partners who we work with to provide your account. As an exception, we may disclose account information to a third-party service provider upon your request, or otherwise only as required by the laws of Lithuania or applicable EU legislation.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-the-account">4. How to use the account</h2>
<p>Each authorised user may, subject to the assigned level of access, operate your account in the TU Online banking, including (depending on the selected account package):</p>
<ul>
<li>view balances and historic transactions (we will refer to this as “account information”);</li>
<li>create payment orders for the execution by us of payment transactions;</li>
<li>make currency conversions (coming soon).</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not automatically issue digital or paper transaction statements, however account statements can at all times be downloaded in the TU Online banking.</p>
<h2 id="a-your-account">4a) Your account</h2>
<p><strong>Collections</strong><br>
You can collect funds into your account by way of euro payment transactions made from accounts held by yourself or third parties outside TU, or by moving funds between your own accounts. Depending on the selected account package, you may also collect funds in other currencies than euro (coming soon), please see available currencies on our Prices Page.</p>
<p>Generally, funds moved between your accounts are credited to the relevant account immediately. Collections from accounts outside TU are generally credited immediately as well, however subject to any required scans or checks we are obliged to perform, e.g. due to the anti-money laundering legislation or for the prevention of fraud, which may take some time.</p>
<p>Sometimes we receive recall requests from e.g. the payer’s bank in respect of a payment transaction intended for your account. You hereby explicitly grant us the authorisation to return such funds according to the recall request when such funds have not yet been credited to your account.</p>
<p>Whilst we aim to process your collections as fast as possible, in some circumstances your funds may be held up by third-party banks, in which case we regrettably are unable to influence the speed of the transaction. Please also note that the sender of the funds must have provided the correct payment details to your account for us to be able to credit your account.</p>
<p><strong>Payouts</strong><br>
By default, you can create payment orders in the TU Online banking to make euro payouts between your accounts or to accounts outside TU using the SEPA network. Depending on the selected account package, you may also create payment orders for payouts in euro or other available currencies (coming soon) using international or local payment networks, please see further details on our Prices Page.</p>
<p>To create a payment order for a payout you need to provide the following information (payouts using international or local payment networks may require additional information):</p>
<ul>
<li>full name of the recipient;</li>
<li>recipient’s account details;</li>
<li>address of the recipient;</li>
<li>amount;</li>
<li>currency; and</li>
<li>payment purpose.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you have created a payment order and included all required information you need to submit the payment order in the Online banking. We will consider that you, by submitting the payment order in the Online banking, gave us your consent and authorised us to execute the payout in accordance with the payment order you have created.</p>
<p>You are aware of and accept that neither a payment order nor a payout can be cancelled or reversed once we have received the payment order. In respect of a payout between your accounts, we receive the payment order immediately upon your submission of the payment order. For a payout in euro using the SEPA network, we receive your payment order immediately upon your submission of the payment order if you submitted it at the latest 14.30 CET on a banking day, and if you submitted it after 14.30 CET, we receive the payment order the next banking day.</p>
<p>A payout intended for a third party may be delayed if the payment order has to be assessed by TU due to legal compliance reasons, such as transaction monitoring requirements. We may, in our sole discretion, reject a payment order if it would be in breach of the agreement or any applicable legislation, or if we suspect that the execution of the payment transaction would be prohibited, for example in breach of international sanctions.</p>
<p>Depending on the currency, public holidays may delay the execution of the payout by one working day.</p>
<p>The above is also applicable if you create a payment order via a third-party payment initiation service provider.</p>
<p>It is your responsibility to ensure the authorised user creating the payment order provides the correct recipient account details. This is important as neither payment orders nor payouts can be cancelled or reversed. Whilst we will try our best to help you recover your funds in circumstances where incorrect recipient account details have been provided, there is a risk that you may lose any funds sent to the wrong account.</p>
<p><strong>How long does it take to make a payout?</strong><br>
A payment order for a payout in euro using the SEPA network needs to be created and submitted at the latest 14.30 CET for TU to execute the payout on the same banking day. For a payment order created after 14.30 CET, TU will execute the payout on the following banking day. The recipient will generally receive the payout the next banking day, however, in some occasion it may take longer depending on the recipient’s bank.</p>
<p>A payment order for a payout in euro between your own accounts is generally executed and credited to the chosen account immediately.</p>
<p>Depending on the currency, public holidays may delay the execution of the payout by one working day.</p>
<h2 id="b-rejected-transactions-refunds-and-unauthorised-use">4b) Rejected transactions, refunds and unauthorised use</h2>
<p>TU may reject any transaction, such as a payout, a collection or an FX transaction, made to or from your account, if we believe that it is in breach of the agreement or of any applicable legislation, rules or regulation.</p>
<p>If you experience an error with any transaction, a payout, a collection or an FX transaction, made to or from your account, please contact us as soon as possible and no later than ten (10) banking days after the transaction was made. We will do our best to help you resolve any issues, however, please note that we cannot guarantee the success of such measures as the error may have been caused by a third party outside of our control. Where we do have control, we may reverse an erroneous transaction or refund any overpayments if we consider it appropriate. A return, depending on the circumstances, may entail third-party fees at your cost, meaning that the returned transaction amounts may be lower than the original transaction. Please note that if you contact us later than ten (10) banking days after you made or received an erroneous transaction, it is unlikely that we will be able to help resolve the matter. We aim to refund or reverse the transaction or to let you know that we cannot refund or reverse the transaction, as applicable, within thirty (30) days of receiving your request. Please note that we may extend this timeframe as necessary due to the complexity of a request.</p>
<p>If it comes to our attention that a deposit has been incorrectly attributed to your account, we will contact you as soon as possible and will take steps to help the sender to recover such funds. This may involve reversing the incorrect transaction or refunding any overpayments on your account with your consent. If you notice any incorrect deposits on the account, please contact our Customer Support immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Unauthorised transactions</strong><br>
You must contact us as soon as you become aware or suspect that someone has unauthorisedly used or stolen from the account, and in no event later than three (3) months following the unauthorised transaction. Upon your notification we will investigate flagged unauthorised transactions. We will refund the funds to your account, unless the unauthorised transaction could take place due to your or an authorised user’s:</p>
<ul>
<li>failure to protect personalised security credentials (including without limitation ordinary or one-time passwords, account credentials, means of communication used with TU for authentication purposes); or</li>
<li>breach of the agreement intentionally or with gross negligence.</li>
</ul>
<p>We reserve the right, without assuming any liability thereof, to debit the account with the refunded amount should we believe that the refund was requested regarding an authorised transaction.</p>
<p><strong>Rejected transactions by the beneficiary’s bank</strong><br>
If an executed payout is rejected by the beneficiary’s bank and transferred back to us (for instance beneficiary’s account being blocked by its bank due to unpaid costs), we will create a collection into your account. If we find everything in order we will credit the funds to your account. Such a return, depending on the circumstances, may entail third-party fees at your cost, meaning that the returned transaction amounts may be lower than the original transaction.</p>
